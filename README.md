Juce-Midi-In-Filter
===================

The aim of this project is to explore various functionalities of JUCE Framwork. The particular outcome is a VST plugin allowing
to filtering midi data. Currently this VST plugin allows you to do two two things: 1) adjust received midi volume and 2) choose receiving midi channel.
Also, the plugin allows storing and restoring parameter values.

TODO: For some reason some host applications are not able to locate the build VST. For example, it works on JUCE VST Host application but Ableton Live
does not recognize it.
