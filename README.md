Juce-Midi-In-Filter
===================

The aim of this project is to explore various midi functionalities the JUCE Framework enables. Currently this VST plugin allows you to do two things: 

1) adjust received midi volume and 2) choose receiving midi channel

Also, the plugin allows storing and restoring parameter values.

TODO: Add returned parameter names so a host may do something with them.
