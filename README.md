Juce-Midi-In-Filter
===================

The aim of this project is to explore various functionalities of the JUCE Framework. The particular outcome is a VST plugin allowing filtering midi data. Currently the VST plugin allows you to do two two things: 

1) adjust received midi volume 
2) choose receiving midi channel

Also, the plugin allows storing and restoring parameter values.

TODO: For some reason some host applications are not able to locate the build VST. For example, it works on JUCE VST Host application but Ableton Live
does not recognise it.
